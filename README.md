# Flattener

A simple library that allows one to easily turn a Java bean of arbitrary complexity (with cyclic references included) into a flat string to string map and vise versa. 

This can be viewed as a new java serialization / deserialization mechanism. However, unlike most of the other well accepted serialization methods, such as XML or Json serialization, Flattener keeps the attribute data type in the serialized form and thus it is much simpler to deserialize.

Since a flat map is much more efficient and easier to work with, this opens up great potentials for the creation of other generic APIs and applications. Below are some that can be created as follow up to this API.

* Generic Serialization / deserialization for any bean (does not have to be declared as Serializable))
* Generic bean mapping externalized and with ability to support complex mapping rules + calculations (see ![xmapper](https://github.com/beanone/xmapper))
* Generic object diffs and updates using delta (see ![beanone](https://github.com/beanone/beanone))
* Generic persistence allow easy navigation from snapshot to snapshot (see ![beanone](https://github.com/beanone/beanone))
* Generic support of undo/redo of objects
* Generic object equals (as a special case for the below)
* Generic rules built for objects-configuration driven (e.g., rules to determine similar beans)

Another very important benefit that many might not realize is that, the act of flattening the object, essentially separates the object structure out so that you have an opportunity to work with object structure meta data directly. It is this advantage that makes it possible to easily implement a sophisticated generic and extensible object mapper (see ![xmapper](https://github.com/beanone/xmapper)).

## Usage

### For flattening:

	Map<String, String> flatted = new FlattenerTool().flat(aBean);

### For unflattening:

	Object aBean = new FlattenerTool().unflat(flatted);

By default, Flattener can handle primitive Java types and their wrapper classes, String, java.util.Date, java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp, BigInterger, BigDecimal and simple enum values. All of which are treated as primitives (that is, attributes of the objects are not serialized since there is not need for that). 

All java.util.Collection objects are handled by a CollectionFlattener and CollectionUnflattener. java.util.Map objects are handled by MapFlattener and MapUnflattener. All array objects are handled by ArrayFlattener and ArrayUnflattener. All other objects are handled by DefaultFlattener and DefaultUnflattener by default.

For advanced users, custom Flatteners and Unflatteners can be registered with FlattenerTool to include custom behaviors. To implement a custom Flattener, simply extend the AbstractFlattener and override doFlat() method. You can also directly implement the Flattener interface. To implement custom Unflattener, simply extend AbstractUnflattener and override doCreateObject() and doPopulate() methods. You can also directly implement Unflattener.
